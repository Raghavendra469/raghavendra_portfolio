          Hello! I'm Raghavendra Kodavalla, a passionate software developer
          specializing in full-stack development. With a strong foundation in
          Java and web technologies, I've developed a deep understanding of both
          front-end and back-end development. My experience ranges from building
          interactive web interfaces to integrating APIs that provide seamless
          functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a knack for problem-solving, and I love creating web
          applications that are not only visually appealing but also provide a
          smooth user experience. Over the years, I've refined my skills in
          JavaScript, React.js, and MySQL, allowing me to work on diverse
          projects that challenge me to learn and grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™ve completed several hands-on internships and training programs,
          where I developed responsive websites, utilized modern frameworks like
          React.js, and deepened my understanding of software development best
          practices. I enjoy keeping up with the latest trends in technology,
          experimenting with new tools, and applying what I learn to real-world
          projects.
